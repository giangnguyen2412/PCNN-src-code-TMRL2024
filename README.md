# AdvisingNets: Learning to Distinguish Correct and Wrong Classifications via Nearest-Neighbor Explanations
## How to run the training for AdvisingNets?
In general, for CUB-200, you need to follow these steps:
1. Sampling positive and negative pairs for training AdvisingNets
> python cub_extract_feature.py
> python copy_and_rename_topk.py
2. Run the training
> python cub_model_training.py
## How to run the inference for AdvisingNets
We provide two scripts to run two applications of AdvisingNets (a) correct/wrong prediction classification and (b) multi-way image classification using the Top-Class Reranking algorithm.
To run (a),
> python cub_infer.py
To run (b),
> python cub_extract_feature_adv_process.py
> python cub_advising_process
## How to visualize qualitative figures for AdvisingNets
1. Corrections of AdvisingNets
> python cub_visualize_corrections.py
2. Training pairs of AdvisingNets
> cub_visualize_training_nns.py
3. Failures of AdvisingNets (please change M2_VISUALIZATION in params.py to True)
> python cub_infer.py
The same steps for Cars-196.
